You **must** have Rails installed in order to run this web application. Please go to http://railsinstaller.org/en and follow the instructions for your operating system.

Once Rails is installed, clone the project repository, navigate, and enter the following commands into your console:
```
bundle install
rake routes
```

Then start your Rails server:
```
rails s
```

Your console should output something similar to the following message:
```
=> Booting Puma
=> Rails 5.0.5 application starting in development on http://localhost:3000
=> Run `rails server -h` for more startup options
```

Navigate to http://<span></span>localhost:#### (where #### is whichever port your server is running on).
